Song Composer

Overviewâ€”the third assignment was to give us a practice with designing in Arduino so we can gain experience with 
microcontroller hardware, serial communication and pulse width modulation.  Where we had to design a program that could play, 
create and store up to four songs.

I.	INTRODUCTION

THe program was supposed to start with a menu where the user had to choose from 3 options being, 
listing the saved songs, creating one and playing one.
 
With the list songs choice the user was prompted to another menu showing all the stored songs.
 
Play song will bring a menu asking you if you want to insert the number of the song you want to play of you want to type in the whole sting.
 
And for the last choice it just let the user input the string (notes) of the song he/she wants to store.

II.	APPLICATION DESIGN

I implemented my program function by function as I found it was the best way to do it, 
I created the menu program then, other functions which were needed by other functions in order to work 
for example like play song is dependent on play note so before starting it, 
I had to make sure that my play note function was working fine.
